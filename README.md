# Laboratory work: Classes and objects.
1. Develop a programming class combining fields and methods according to your variant assignment. Use the capabilities of the C++ language to protect the data. If necessary, use getters and setters to access private data. 

Implement as class methods:
* a function for entering data from the keyboard;
* function of reading data from a text fil;
* the function for displaying the content on the screen;
* the function for writing contents to a text or binary file.
2. Locate the developed class in a separate program module. Place class declaration and prototypes of all used functions to the module's header file, definitions of all class methods and individual functions to the implementation file.

In the main program module:
* create an array of several objects (dynamically);
* fill the array with data, using appropriate methods;
* display the array on the screen, using appropriate methods;
* demonstrate the work of additional functions from your task.


### Variant 2 

Subject area: Real estate market.\
Structured data type: Flat in a multi-storey building (flat)\
Structure elements:
* Number of rooms;
* Total floor space;
* Living space;
* Floor;
* Storeys;
* District. 

Task:
1) Calculate the total floor area of flats in a given district (enter the name of the district from the keyboard).
2) Print the data for all flats on the top floor of a multi-storey building (5 or more storeys).
